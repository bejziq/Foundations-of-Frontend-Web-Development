    <h1>Enigma</h1>
    <img src="images/project-2.png" alt="">
    <p>This project aims to develop a mobile application, "Enigma," that functions as a reminder system with an added layer of encryption. Users can create reminders with text messages but choose to encrypt them with a personalized code before setting the date and time for the notification.

        Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:
        
        Note Taking: Users can create reminders with detailed text messages.
        Encryption: The app offers an encryption feature where users can encode their reminders with a custom code they create. This adds a layer of privacy, ensuring only the user with the decryption key can understand the full message when the reminder pops up.
        Notification System: Reminders are scheduled with specific dates and times, and the app triggers notifications to alert users at the designated moment.</p>
    <p>
        Possible Use Cases:
        
        Personal Notes: Encrypting reminders can be useful for jotting down confidential or private information that you only want yourself to access later.
        Gift Planning: Leaving cryptic reminders with encrypted messages about birthdays or upcoming events can add a layer of surprise and intrigue.
        Creative Prompts: Writers or artists can use the app to store encrypted snippets of ideas or prompts for future reference.
        Project Status:
        
        The text in the image suggests the project might be in the early stages of development. The cryptic message "Save yourself" could be a placeholder reminder or a potential prompt within the app.
    </p>

    <p>Future Development:
        
        Implementing different encryption algorithms for varying levels of security.
        Integrating biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition) for unlocking encrypted reminders.
        Allowing users to share encrypted reminders with others who possess the decryption key.
        By combining reminder functionalities with encryption, Enigma intends to provide a secure and potentially fun way for users to manage their tasks and notes on their mobile devices.</p>
